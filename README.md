# Cryptography and Data Security Technologies
## Coding Project
### Instrcution :
Take any cryptographic algorithm (for example: block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, DES, AES, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, miniblockchain, El Gamal encryption, Elliptic curve encryption, etc...)

The language used is C# and I tried to reproduce a block ciphers algorithm.
